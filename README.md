# Project base for codekit-starter
These are the base files for starting out a new project based on [codekit-starter](https://github.com/toonetown/codekit-starter).  This branch is used for bootstrapping the base project which will then merge in the remainder of codekit-starter.

** You DO NOT (nor should not) ever have to check this branch out yourself unless you know what you are doing!!! **

Instead, you should run the following command:

    bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/toonetown/codekit-starter/project-base/install) [dirname]

Where `[dirname]` is the output directory to check out into.

See the documentation on [the master branch](https://github.com/toonetown/codekit-starter) for details.
